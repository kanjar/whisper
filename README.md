# Whispering Gophers
## Network programming in Go

**This is a work in progress so please don't share it around just yet.**

For a start, look at [the slides](http://talks.golang.org/github.com/nf/whisper/talk.slide).

Then install the utility library:

	go get github.com/nf/whisper/util

This will also download the rest of this repo, which includes some sample implementations for each step (`part1`, `part2`, etc). The `peer` directory contains a complete final implementation.
